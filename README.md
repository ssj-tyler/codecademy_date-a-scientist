My final portfolio project for Codecademy's Data Scientist - Machine Learning Specialist Career Path.

Welcome! Although this is not the first portfolio project I have worked through via Codecademy this will be the first I will accomplish entirely through GitHub.

*10 minutes later*

It appears the Excel file that contains my data is too big to upload to GitHub, so I will have to complete the project locally and upload it post-facto. C'est la vie.

UPDATE: 4/12/23
The current project that has been uploaded is an incomplete machine model. I missed a step or two in the data wrangling process and need to re-tool the model but I've uploaded the incomplete work thus far.
